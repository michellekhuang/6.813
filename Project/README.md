Setup
-----
First, install [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).

Then run the commands in your terminal:
```
npm install
gulp
```

`npm install`
-------------
This command installs the required Node.js modules (listed in `package.json`).

`gulp`
------
This command does three things:
1. Compiles SCSS into CSS.
2. Compiles new Javascript into old Javascript that will run in your web browser.
3. Starts the web server so you can access the webpage at `localhost:3000`.
